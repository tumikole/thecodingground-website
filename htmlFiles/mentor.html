     Having spent over 10 years building software I have seen how
            software has enabled people, myself included, to not only
            improve themselves but also the communities around them.Code has
            broken down walls for me. I've seen first hand how through
            apprenticeship anyone can learn how to build beautiful and
       meaningful things through code.

       Software development has been one of my many passions since I
            was 12 years old. Professionally, I've been programming for
            finance and health research. Understanding how to work with
            customers to really understand the problems and taking small
            steps towards solving these problems in a sustainable way, is
            even harder than writing code. Being guided through all aspects
            close to nine years in various industries including education,
            of software development by an experienced mentor leads software
            craftsmen on a journey to mastery

      Moral Jera grew up in South Africa, Gauteng in a township called Olievenhoutbosch. He was raised by a single mother who made sure that she passed down a lot of valuable aspects of life to him. He was a little bit lucky because his mother managed to take him to a private school. After all, it introduced him to better education and better resources. He became fixated with computers in general, whilst doing grade 10 by that time he had no idea how computers operated, he just loved their physical appearance and went head over heels when he heard the sound his fingers made when dancing on the keyboard. He embarked on his software development journey in 2018 when he joined The Coding Ground. He is a devoted guy who tries by all means to perfect his work. He dedicated all of his energy and time to his Tech work. Because of consecrating his time he finished studying with The Coding Ground Earlier than expected and landed himself a job in a company called Devson. He also helps and assists students at The coding Ground in their growth and learning. His special fascination not only lies in uplifting himself but also in helping others understand how to solve problems that they encounter in their coding journey. As the saying goes when one hand washes another poverty could only be a story to be told, he did wash a lot of hands to help them reach their full potential. Dedication uplifted his life, so you can also do it.
