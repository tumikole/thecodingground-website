         Hello, my name is Kamvalethu Zitho. I was born in the Eastern Cape, in a Township called Cala. Cala is a small,
         underdeveloped area so when I was 8, I had to relocate to start school in Johannesburg. Growing up, I had a sharp mind, 
         a strong sense of sympathy, and excellent problem-solving skills which made me stand out from other children. 
         I loved reading books, writing and also loved spending time alone. I completed my Matric in the year 2020 and 
         considered pursuing a career as an administrative lawyer or a chef but when I was introduced to co<span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">ding through
        a mutual friend, I gave it a try and fell in love with it instantly and have never looked back. I am a hard worker
         and if given an opportunity I persevere. I like to think of myself as a self-motivated and analytical thinker. One of 
         the mottos I live by is “Principles only mean something if you stick by them when they are inconvenient”. I believe that 
         words are powerful and can be used to make a significant impact on the lives of others. Therefore, I carefully use the power of 
         to create genuine connections and lasting relationships with people in my professional and personal life.</span><button onclick="readMore('Kamvalethu')" id="myButton">Read more</button>

          Hi, my name is Muano Nevhufumba. I was born in Limpopo and raised in a small
           village called Tshivhilwi. As a child I grew up building things with my hands. 
           I would build a car using wires and every child would love the car and ask me to 
           build one for them. That was my passion and as a child and I dreamt of building a real
            car for myself one day when I was grown up. When I matriculated I wanted to study computer 
            science because my brother was studying it and when I saw the work he was doing I fell in love 
            with the course. I remember one friend of mine always<span id="dots">...</span><span style="color:black" id="more">used to talk about C++ and how challenging

            varsity or college and register for IT (information technology) when I found out about The Coding Ground. 
            I applied and was accepted and now I’m here learning how to program and I’m enjoying each and every single day

          Hi, my name is Njabulo Zulu. I am originally from a small town called Eshowe
           in KwaZulu Natal, but I grew up in Gauteng, mostly in Centurion, Olievenhoutbosch. 
           I am an individual who strongly believes in the butterfly effect, In which a tiny change
            can have a huge impact on a person's life. For example, the path that I am on is being a
             software engineer. If my parents never decided to leave Tembisa where we used to live, I
              don't think I would be here today. lucky enough they made a choice to move to a different 
              place which led to us living in Olieven<span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">houtbosch where I met one of my best friends who introduced 
              me to playing video games. This also led to us falling in love with building computers and that led 
              to him being introduced to coding and programming and that was passed down to me because of our friendship.
               Ever since that day, I fell in love with it. I show my strengths through my actions and better myself by being 
               aware of my weaknesses and trying to better myself. My biggest weakness is time management, which I think is caused
                by me trying to do a lot of things at once. And I am trying to turn my weakness into one of my strengths by integrating a
                 schedule to help me manage my time better.</span><button onclick="readMore('Njabulo')" id="myButton">Read more</button>
