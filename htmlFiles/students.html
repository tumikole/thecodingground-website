          Kamvalethu Zitho was born in the Eastern Cape, in a Township called Cala at Cala Hospital. She spent almost 8
          years of her life in the Eastern Cape but
          later moved to Gauteng, because of the underdeveloped village she came from, she had to relocate to start
          school at Johannesburg. She was a genius growing
          up and that started to show at a very early stage of her life. For her age, she was as right as rain because
          you could see that she was going to be a very wise
          young person. Growing up Kamvalethu possessed a very good personality trait which is sympathy and that made
          her stand out from other children, she also
          had excellent problem-solving skills. She showed interest in becoming a Lawyer specifically being an
          Administrative lawyer at the age of 14 and also being a
          Chef because it was one of her favorite things to do. She loved reading books, writing and also loved spending
          most of her time alone. She completed her
          Matric in the year 2020. She then got introduced to Coding through a mutual friend and she found it
          interesting, she gave it a try and fell in love with it instantly
          she has never looked back. Kamvalethu then joined The Coding Ground in 2021 and is still a student there.
          Kamvalethu is a hard worker, she is capable if given
          the opportunity and she perseveres. She has the ability to learn quickly and enjoys a challenge communicating
          orally and in writing. Kamvalethu likes to think
          of herself as self-motivated, a critical, and an analytical thinker. One of the mottos she says she lives by
          is 'Principles only mean something if you stick by them when they’re inconvenient and she still lives by it
          till to date.

          My name is Ramollo Samuel Tumisang and I was born in the province of North West, in a small village called
          Madidi but currently residing at Centurion
          (Olievenhoutbosch). I was raised by my grandparents untill I became an adult. Since childhood, I have been
          passionate about personal computers and media
          designs. I completed my matric in 2009 and went to DSDC college the following year for a matric upgrade hoping
          to enroll at one of the best universities in
          Africa. I was hoping to do Multimedia design. In 2012 I enrolled at Sokhele college for a call center
          certificate and Worked for Affinity mobile sponsored
          by 8ta, based in Sunnyside Pretoria. I also completed a security grade E - C certificate in 2013. In 2015
          joined Imvula Quality Protection and served my
          three-year contract with no faulty issues. In 2016 I was awarded the commendation of service excellence at
          Imvula Quality Protection for saving one of my
          colleague’s life. I joined THE CODING GROUND in 2021 as a full-stack software developer. I joined THE CODING
          GROUND because I love coding I wanted to
          become the best software developers in the world. Currently, I’m doing frontend development. with the months
          that I have spent here, I was able to learn a few
          programming languages and frameworks. I am just glad that I got a chance to fulfill my dream of becoming a
          software developer.

          Lindokuhle Angel Mazibuko was born and raised in Diepsloot and later moved to RiversideView. Like any other
          alive human being I faced a lot of hardships
          along the way and the important part is that I found myself again. As a kid I fell in love with literature and
          tried writing my own thoughts. The first time
          I ever fell in love with literature was when I first read the novel titled Two Of Kind Diaries(It's A Twin
          Thing), and there I was falling in love with how
          they played around with words and how they sent a fantasy message through rich language. For a long time I
          wanted to be a professional writer, I wanted to
          express my emotions through writing but realised that although writing was my passion, it still was a hobby.
          High School gave me the glimpse of what real
          life looked like, I'm the kind of person who tries to escape life whenever she gets a chance hence I developed
          an interest in computers in general. From
          there on I fell in love with programming and I found my way to coding. The Coding Ground developed my life and
          I've never been happier.

          Muano Nevhufumba was born and bred in a small village called Tshiliwi in Limpopo. As a kid I grew up enjoying
          building things with my hands, I will build
          myself cars using wires and every kid would love the cars that I have built and they would ask me to also
          build one for them, that was my passion as a kid.
          When I matriculated I wanted to study computer science, the reason behind studying computer science is that I
          saw the work that my brother was doing and I
          just instantly fell in love with the course, I remember a friend of mine who will always talk about C++ and
          how challenging it was but it didn’t scare me
          off, I still wanted to study it. I don’t know what changed my mind or how it did but I found myself studying
          Geology and deep down I knew I wanted to study
          computer science. I wanted to register for IT (information technology), that’s when I found out about The
          Coding Ground. I found that I can still learn how
          to program, then I followed the process of joining The Coding Ground. I was one of the few who got selected to
          be a part of The Coding Ground. At the moment
          I am at The Coding Ground learning how to program. I’m enjoying every single day that I spend here, I have no
          regret that I left everything behind to finally
          do something that I have always wanted to do.

          Wongani Skosana is a competent young adult whose goal has been nothing but to aim for the stars. He always
          believed in self-motivation because growing
          up in a crowded location required him to trust himself more than he trusted others. Wongani was born in South
          Africa, Gauteng, and was raised in a small
          overcrowded township,located north of Johannesburg called Diepsloot. His situation never stopped him from
          conquering it pushed him to work extra hard so
          he can escape his earlier life.Before Coding found him he had dreams of becoming a mechanical engineer, yet
          he's very grateful for falling in love with
          coding and making it his priority. With Coding he managed to find a better version of himself, spending most
          of his time thinking and talking about code
          made him realize how much he wanted to change the world with coding. He's elated for finding his calling in
          coding and plans on staying true to it. He has
          been a student of The Coding Ground for 13 full months, and he's thankful to The Coding Ground for helping him
          reach his full potential. The coding ground
          helped him acquire some skills which he needed in the Tech industry. Wongani Skosana believes in divide and
          conquer because he believes that working alone
          helps you think deeper within yourself and your working speed automatically rises.

          Hi, My name is Njabulo Zulu, and to lighten up the mood I would say a joke but just to save electricity and
          the computer's ink let's just get into it.
          I am originally from KZN in a small town called Eshowe, but I grew up in Gauteng mostly in Pretoria centurion
          Olievenhoutbosch. I am an individual
          who strongly believes in the butterfly effect, In which a tiny change can have a huge impact on a person's
          life. For example, the path that I am on is
          being a software engineer, if my parents never decided to leave Tembisa where we used to live, I don't think I
          would be here today. lucky enough they
          made a choice of moving to a different place which led to us ending up living in Olievenhoutbosch where I met
          one of my best friends who introduced me
          to playing video games. This also led to us falling in love with building computers and that led to him being
          introduced to coding and programming and
          that was passed down to me because of our friendship. ever since that day, I fell in love with it. To add on
          top of that just to speak about my strengths
          and weaknesses, what I can say is I show my strength through my actions and weaknesses by being aware of them
          and trying to better myself. My biggest
          weakness is time management, which is trying to manage my time to work better for me, and I think that is
          caused by me trying to do a lot of things at once.

          My name is Sibonokuhle Nkabinde, I was born on the 27th of November 1999 in a township called Lady Smith
          located in the province of Kwa-Zulu Natal.
          I am a humble, down-to-earth kind person. I follow my heart and most important I believe in myself. I have a
          steady source of motivation that drives
          me to do my best. My ambitions are driven by my passion to conquer and do what makes me happy. I always thrive
          on challenges and constantly set a goal
          for myself. Settling is out of my comfort zone hence I'm always looking for an opportunity to do better and
          achieve greatness. I am also highly organized
          I always take notes and I use serious tools to help myself stay on top of deadlines. looking for positivity in
          everything is an essential trait of mine, I
          believe that every negative detail has a tiny positive detail in it. My past does not determine my future. I
          am currently doing software development at The
          Coding Ground, I started this journey in the year 2020. The Coding Ground taught me what code is and how to
          code. I didn't know anything about code, their
          patience with me is what motivated me and kept me on my feet. For the time I have spent here, I managed to
          grab a few skills and more knowledge about
          coding.
