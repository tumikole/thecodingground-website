</div>

<p>Kamvalethu Zitho was born in the Eastern Cape, in a Township called Cala at Cala Hospital. She spent almost 8 years of her life in the Eastern Cape but 
later moved to Gauteng, because of the underdeveloped village she came from, she had to relocate to start school at Johannesburg. She was a genius growing up 
and that started to show at a very early stage of her life. For her age, she was as right as rain because you could see that she was going to be a very wise 
young person. Growing up Kamvalethu possessed a very good personality trait which is sympathy and that made her stand out from other children, she also had 
excellent problem-solving skills. She showed interest in becoming a Lawyer specifically being an Administrative lawyer at the age of 14 and also being a Chef 
because it was one of her favorite things to do.  She loved reading books, writing and also loved spending most of her time alone. She completed her Matric in 
the year 2020. She then got introduced to Coding through a mutual friend and she found it interesting, she gave it a try and fell in love with it instantly she 
has never looked back. Kamvalethu then joined The Coding Ground in 2021 and is still a student there. Kamvalethu is a hard worker, she is capable if given the 
opportunity and she perseveres. She has the ability to learn quickly and enjoys a challenge communicating orally and in writing.
Kamvalethu likes to think of herself as self-motivated, a critical, and an analytical thinker. One of the mottos she says she lives by is 'Principles only 
mean something if you stick by them when they’re inconvenient'and she still lives by it till to date.

<p>My name is Ramollo Samuel Tumisang and I was born in the province of North West, in a small village called Madidi but currently residing at Centurion
  (Olievenhoutbosch). I was raised by my grandparents untill I became an adult. Since childhood, I have been passionate about personal computers and media 
  designs. I completed my matric in 2009 and went to DSDC college the following year for a matric upgrade hoping to enroll at one of the best universities in 
  Africa. I was hoping to do Multimedia design. In 2012 I enrolled at Sokhele college for a call center certificate and Worked for Affinity mobile sponsored 
  by 8ta, based in Sunnyside Pretoria. I also completed a security grade E - C certificate in 2013. In 2015 joined Imvula Quality Protection and served my 
  three-year contract with no faulty issues. In 2016 I was awarded the commendation of service excellence at Imvula Quality Protection for saving one of my
  colleague’s life. I joined THE CODING GROUND in 2021 as a full-stack software developer. I joined THE CODING GROUND because I love coding I wanted to become
  the best software developers in the world. Currently, I’m doing frontend development. with the months that I have spent here, I was able to learn a few 
  programming languages and frameworks. I am just glad that I got a chance to fulfill my dream of becoming a software developer.

<p>Lindokuhle Angel Mazibuko was born and raised in Diepsloot and later moved to RiversideView. Like any other alive human being I faced a lot of hardships 
  along the way and the important part is that I found myself again. As a kid I fell in love with literature and tried writing my own thoughts. The first time
  I ever fell in love with literature was when I first read the novel titled Two Of Kind Diaries(It's A Twin Thing), and there I was falling in love with how 
  they played around with words and how they sent a fantasy message through rich language. For a long time I wanted to be a professional writer, I wanted to 
  express my emotions through writing but realised that although writing was my passion, it still was a hobby. High School gave me the glimpse of what real 
  life looked like, I'm the kind of person who tries to escape life whenever she gets a chance hence I developed an interest in computers in general. From 
  there on I fell in love with programming and I found my way to coding. The Coding Ground developed my life and I've never been happier.

<p>Muano Nevhufumba was born and bred in a small village called Tshiliwi in Limpopo. As a kid I grew up enjoying building things with my hands, I will build
  myself cars using wires and every kid would love the cars that I have built and they would ask me to also build one for them, that was my passion as a kid. 
  When I matriculated I wanted to study computer science, the reason behind studying computer science is that I saw the work that my brother was doing and I 
  just instantly fell in love with the course, I remember a friend of mine who will always talk about C++ and how challenging it was but it didn’t scare me 
  off, I still wanted to study it. I don’t know what changed my mind or how it did but I found myself studying Geology and deep down I knew I wanted to study 
  computer science. I wanted to register for IT (information technology), that’s when I found out about The Coding Ground. I found that I can still learn how 
  to program, then I followed the process of joining The Coding Ground. I  was one of the few who got selected to be a part of The Coding Ground. At the moment
  I am at The Coding Ground learning how to program. I’m enjoying every single day that I spend here, I have no regret that I left everything behind to finally
   do something that I have always wanted to do.
