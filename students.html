<p>Kamvalethu Zitho was born in the Eastern Cape, in a Township called Cala at Cala Hospital. She spent almost 8 years of her life in the Eastern Cape but 
later moved to Gauteng, because of the underdeveloped village she came from, she had to relocate to start school at Johannesburg. She was a genius growing up 
and that started to show at a very early stage of her life. For her age, she was as right as rain because you could see that she was going to be a very wise 
young person. Growing up Kamvalethu possessed a very good personality trait which is sympathy and that made her stand out from other children, she also had 
excellent problem-solving skills. She showed interest in becoming a Lawyer specifically being an Administrative lawyer at the age of 14 and also being a Chef 
because it was one of her favorite things to do.  She loved reading books, writing and also loved spending most of her time alone. She completed her Matric in 
the year 2020. She then got introduced to Coding through a mutual friend and she found it interesting, she gave it a try and fell in love with it instantly she 
has never looked back. Kamvalethu then joined The Coding Ground in 2021 and is still a student there. Kamvalethu is a hard worker, she is capable if given the 
opportunity and she perseveres. She has the ability to learn quickly and enjoys a challenge communicating orally and in writing.
Kamvalethu likes to think of herself as self-motivated, a critical, and an analytical thinker. One of the mottos she says she lives by is 'Principles only 
mean something if you stick by them when they’re inconvenient'and she still lives by it till to date.
