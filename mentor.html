                  Having spent over 10 years building software I have seen how
                  software has enabled people, myself included, to not only
                  improve themselves but also the communities around them.Code has
                  broken down walls for me. I've seen first hand how through
                  apprenticeship anyone can learn how to build beautiful and
                  meaningful things through code.

                  Software development has been one of my many passions since I
                  was 12 years old. Professionally, I've been programming for
                  finance and health research. Understanding how to work with
                  customers to really understand the problems and taking small
                  steps towards solving these problems in a sustainable way, is
                  even harder than writing code. Being guided through all aspects
                  close to nine years in various industries including education,
                  of software development by an experienced mentor leads software
                  craftsmen on a journey to mastery.

                  Born in Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) Jason grew up spending large
                  amounts of his time writing programs in any programming language
                  he could get his hands on. This keen interest led to a
                  post-graduate Engineering degree at WITS with focus on Computer
                  Science and Telecommunications.
